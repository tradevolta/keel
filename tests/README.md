# tests/

| Directory | What | Arrives in |
|---|---|---|
| `trace_host/` | `Keel.Trace` on the host, read back by an independent model of an RTT probe (`gnat_native`) | Chapter 5 |
| `units_host/` | `Keel.Units` literals on the host: accepted and rejected forms (`gnat_native`) | Chapter 6 |
| `gpio_host/` | `Keel.GPIO` on `Keel.GPIO.Fake`: claiming, contracts, pulls, `Debounce`, the signatures and interfaces (`gnat_native`, `-gnata`) | Chapter 7 |
| `gpio_proof/` | GNATprove proves `Keel.GPIO.Debounce` (`gnatprove` 16.1.0) | Chapter 7 |

The host tests are plain Ada mains with a small `Check` procedure,
not AUnit. Planned: `hil/` (hardware-in-the-loop scenarios) and
`proof/` (GNATprove projects, Chapter 24; `gpio_proof/` moves there).
`tools/ci-build` builds and runs every crate here, and proves the
ones that depend on `gnatprove`.
